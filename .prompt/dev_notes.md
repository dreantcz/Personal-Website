### AI Reflection
AI tools like ChatGPT helped me tremendously throughout the creation of my website. All of the grunt work that goes into manually creating an HTML and CSS site. There are a lot of little details that go into an HTML site such as <main>, <p>, and <li> that take a long time to ensure each part is correctly formatted. AI allowed me to complete this in seconds which was a great time saver. AI did make a couple mistakes mainly in the naming of referenced files as well as some formatting errors. This required some manual modification but it did get a lot of the code right on the first attempt. I made sure to double check everything and add some elements of my own like the screenshots and resume format to balance the load between myself and the AI. Moving forward it will be interesting to see how much more we dive into websites and making them more interactive and complex with the help of AI.
